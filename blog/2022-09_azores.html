            On our first day we got a taxi up to Sete Cidades. We couldn't see anything from the viewpoint because of
            the cloud. We hiked down to the lake, kayaked for an hour, and hiked back up again.

            The clouds had cleared by then, and we could see this.

            We had the idea to rent bikes and cycle up the volcano. We didn't last long cycling and pushed the bikes up
            722m, which took about 3 hours. We couldn't see much on the way up because we were in a cloud.

            We got to the viewpoint at the top and after about 15 minutes the clouds cleared and we saw this. You can
            just about see the people standing on the sand if you zoom in.
